## MoviesDatabase API Overview
The MoviesDatabase API, such as The Movie Database (TMDb), is a RESTful service offering comprehensive data on movies, TV shows, actors, images, and videos. It supports search queries, movie/TV details, recommendations, reviews, and more, often with multilingual and high-quality media support. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Version
Currently, the TMDb API v3 is officially documented and stable, while v4 is in progress. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Available Endpoints
Main endpoints include:
- **GET /movie/{movie_id}** – Retrieve movie details  
- **GET /search/movie** – Search for movies by title  
- **GET /movie/{movie_id}/credits** – Cast and crew information  
- **GET /movie/{movie_id}/reviews**, **/recommendations**, **/similar**, **/top_rated**, **/popular**, **/now_playing**, **/upcoming**  
- **GET /configuration** – Base URLs, image sizes, and supported languages :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Request and Response Format
A typical **request** (RESTful GET with API key):
**Response** is JSON, for example:
```json
{
  "id": 27205,
  "title": "Inception",
  "genres": [{"id":28,"name":"Action"}],
  "release_date": "2010-07-15",
  "overview": "...",
  "... more fields ..."
}

## Error Handling 

{
  "status_code": 7,
  "status_message": "Invalid API key: You must be granted a valid key.",
  "success": false
}

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

1. Create the project directory `alx-project-0x14`.
2. Inside it, create **README.md** and paste the structured content above.
3. Adjust details if you're using a different MoviesDatabase API (e.g., OMDb); just mirror the structure using that API's documentation.
4. You can later add your own TypeScript interface examples for request/response shapes based on the JSON samples.
