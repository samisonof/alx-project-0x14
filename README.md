## MoviesDatabase API Overview
The MoviesDatabase API, such as The Movie Database (TMDb), is a RESTful service offering comprehensive data on movies, TV shows, actors, images, and videos. It supports search queries, movie/TV details, recommendations, reviews, and more, often with multilingual and high-quality media support. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Version
Currently, the TMDb API v3 is officially documented and stable, while v4 is in progress. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Available Endpoints
Main endpoints include:
- **GET /movie/{movie_id}** – Retrieve movie details  
- **GET /search/movie** – Search for movies by title  
- **GET /movie/{movie_id}/credits** – Cast and crew information  
- **GET /movie/{movie_id}/reviews**, **/recommendations**, **/similar**, **/top_rated**, **/popular**, **/now_playing**, **/upcoming**  
- **GET /configuration** – Base URLs, image sizes, and supported languages :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Request and Response Format
This section describes the typical structure of a request sent to the API and the format of the response object received.

Request Format

Requests to the API are typically sent as HTTP POST or GET requests with a JSON payload. The request object usually contains the necessary parameters or data required by the endpoint.

Example 

{
  "userId": "12345",
  "query": "search term",
  "limit": 10,
  "filters": {
    "status": "active",
    "category": "technology"
  }
}


## Error Handling

When interacting with the MoviesDatabase API, it is important to handle errors gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience. The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of a request:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the response contains the expected data.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed. This usually means the API key is missing, invalid, or revoked. Verify your API key and ensure it is included in your requests.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist. Check the resource ID or endpoint for typos.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: You have exceeded the API rate limit. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff and pause requests for a certain time before retrying.
- **5xx Server Errors**: These indicate server-side issues. Retry the request after some delay, and if errors persist, check the API status or contact support.

**Best Practices for Error Handling:**

- Always check the HTTP status code in the API response.
- Parse and log error messages returned in the response body to aid debugging.
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors (e.g., 429 and 5xx responses).
- Provide user-friendly messages or fallback content in your application when errors occur.

Example in pseudocode:

```ts
if (response.status === 429) {
  // wait exponentially longer before retrying
} else if (response.status >= 500) {
  // retry after delay
} else if (response.status === 401) {
  // alert about invalid API key
} else if (response.status === 404) {
  // notify resource not found
}
